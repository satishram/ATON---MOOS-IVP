# ATON---MOOS-IVP
Developing Marine Autonomous Framework with MOOS IVP along with ATON Development

MIT MOOS IVP Framework is totally platform ,sensing and most flexible autonomous platform available across so the basic system consist of surface and payload or underwater systems 
Both the systems have independent MOOS and BHV Source to communicate and transfer data between them where the surface being the master send information about navigation ,thrust and returns with the data from the payload about the position,heading,depth and others 
ATON framework written for testing is been shared here for students to gain more knowledge and these code helps to connect the commands from MOOS IVP and Control the thrusters accordingly 

Raspberry pi and Arduino Mega Been Used along with Topside Intel NUC With Blue Robotics ROV System 

Pls feel free to reach us to know more at one2one@arobot.in 

Currently we are working with Interfacing ATON MOOS IVP with Multibeam SOnar and Residential AUV/ROV development programs for Academics and Research

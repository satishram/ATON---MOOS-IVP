# ATON---MOOS-IVP
Developing Marine Autonomous Framework with MOOS IVP along with ATON Development

MIT MOOS IVP Framework is autonomy,sensing and most flexible platform for marine autonomous vehicle.
The basic system consist of surface and payload or underwater systems 

Both the systems have independent MOOS and BHV Source to communicate and transfer data between them where the surface being the master send information about navigation ,thrust and returns with the data from the payload about the position,heading,depth and others 

ATON framework written for testing is been shared here for students/researchers to gain more knowledge and these code helps to connect the commands from MOOS IVP and Control the thrusters accordingly 

Raspberry pi and Arduino Mega Been Used along with Topside Intel NUC With Blue Robotics ROV System
